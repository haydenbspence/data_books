# Data Books
A highly currated collection of books on statistical programming and data science topics, many are open source and free. Some authors also include github repositories to accompany their book. Some courses and other resources may be included in this list as well.

## Criteria for Reference Selection

- Relevent to Data Science, Statistics, Statistical Programming
- Emphesis on strong mathematical foundations
- Range of difficulty
- Practical applications, ideally with code repositories
- Theoretical understanding
- Reputable authors and sources
- A mix of current and evergreen, and limited bleeding edge
- Accessibility, ideally free and open-source

## Setup

You can use the [reference.bib](./reference.bib) with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or another reference manager that can import BibTeX. Otherwise, the references are listed.
